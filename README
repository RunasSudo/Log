Log is a plugin that logs block changes. It's aim is to be a feature-filled but lightweight alternative to BigBrother.
Log is designed for small-medium sized servers where the main focus is identifying and banning the griefer, rather than fixing the griefed structure (backups should be used for that).
Compatible with 617 onwards. Latest build officially tested on 1240. Reported working on 1492.
